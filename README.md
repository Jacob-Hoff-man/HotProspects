# HotProspects
An iOS application to track who you have met at any conference where all attendees are using the application. The application generates a unique QR code for each attendee. A user may scan any QR codes to add another user to their list for following up with later on. The application utilizes TabView to provide a sleek UI tab bar. Additionally, custom data is shared across each view using environment objects. The app utilizes the UserNotifications framework to allow a user to enable notifications for contacting scanned attendees after a period of time.  A custom package dependency--provided by Paul Hudson from hackingwithswift.com--was used to enable QR code scanning. CoreImage was used to generate a custom QR code based off some user-inputted data.
